#Following changes are required to be done:

cd hadoop/etc/hadoop/

ls

#we need to change 5 files given in folder named "HadoopFiles Required to be changed"

mapred-site.xml
core-site.xml
hdfs-site.xml
yarn-site.xml
hadoop-env.sh


Now go to hadoop/bin 

add the master's address in Slaves file.
like following
add master DNS



Mount Disk a Disk using script provided following for D2.xlarge

RaidScript.sh file


format name node

./hadoop namenode -format

Now go to hadoop/sbin folder 

./start-all.sh

execute jps
it should display 

15627 DataNode
16002 ResourceManager
15840 SecondaryNameNode
16470 Jps
16165 NodeManager
15457 NameNode




Go to mounted drive and generate file using gensort

create new directory in hdfs

bin/hadoop fs -mkdir /src

put the generated file to hdfs

bin/hadoop fs -put /vinit/64/inputfile /src

Off the safe mode
bin/hadoop dfsadmin -safemode leave

running Tera Sort

bin/hadoop jar "path to your sorting jar file" "jar name" /src output


//fetching output to local disk

bin/hadoop fs -get output /vinit/Output1Gb


Go to output file

cd /vinit/Output1Gb/

get the Head and Tail of output

head -10 part-r-00000 

tail -10 part-r-00000 






--------------------Changes required to configure  16 Nodes Cluster --------------------------------------------------


Create the instance as above and follow all the steps untill Mount Disk step:


Change in hosts file

cd /etc
sudo nano hosts

add the public DNS and Private IP of master

create the Images of Instance on AWS

open the terminator (application where you can run multiple terminal in broadcast mode)

In Master's
/etc/hosts //add all Ips of slaves

 
In slaves /etc/hosts instance add all its own IP and master's IP

In master's slaves file add all the ips of slave instances

now generate Keygen in master 

eval "$(ssh-agent)"

chmod 400 cloud.pem
ssh-add cloud.pem

ssh-keygen -t rsa

 ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub "public DNS for master"

 Follow the following for all slaves
 
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub "public DNS of slave"

after adding in all slaves provide the permission

chmod 0600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys 


Now start with namenode format like a regular configuration as above
